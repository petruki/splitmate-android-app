## The UI

Here it goes some screenshots from our mate app.

#### 1. Sign In / Home / Event Detail
SplitMATE has a cloud API that is responsible for centralizing the data and business logic.
It is possible to work offline as the data is also synchronized locally.

#### 2. Item/Task List / Main Menu / Member List
We optimized the way data is refreshed. Our real-time sync solution provides a smoother transition with little network bottleneck.

**Why is it so important?**
- It helps me to release it to the flagship app stores - Google Play, iOS App Store.
- It helps me to continue improving it since I built it for free.
- It helps everyone to have a better service quality since cloud hosting services are essential to improve the overall performance.
